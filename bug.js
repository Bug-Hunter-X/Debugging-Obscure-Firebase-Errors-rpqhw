The Firebase SDKs sometimes throw errors that aren't immediately obvious. For example, when dealing with Firestore, an improperly structured query can result in an error that doesn't clearly indicate the cause.  Another common issue is that sometimes the error messages may not provide enough context, making debugging difficult.  Additionally, asynchronous operations in Firebase can lead to race conditions that result in subtle and hard-to-track bugs, especially when dealing with multiple listeners or transactions.
